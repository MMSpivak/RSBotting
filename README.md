Bot scripts for popular game Old School RuneScape written by me using Java and API's

These scripts have been written for both TRiBot and OSBot clients. Clients are the main way your script is taken and then executed in the game. They also provide an API to interact with the game in a code form. My goal is to increase my coding knowledge, learn more about RuneScape, and generally have fun by creating these scripts. I had a lot of time over the summer of 2020 due to COVID and decided to learn how to code bots which I have continued to due in a limited fashion throughout the school year. I have only recently made this GitHub in order to showcase my abilities in coding and the Java language.

OSRS stands for Old School RuneScape, a MMORPG made my Jagex. I have played this game a lot when I was younger so it has a lot of nostalgia for me when going back and botting tasks I have done for hours on end in the past. Hopefully it gives you a better idea of my capabilities and my drive to learn and apply new skills.
